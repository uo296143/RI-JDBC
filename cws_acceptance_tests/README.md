# Test Organization and Architecture

This document explains the test organization methodology used in this project, specifically designed to overcome common Cucumber testing challenges while maintaining clean, maintainable code.

## Overview

Our testing framework is built around a feature-centric approach where each `.feature` file represents scenarios for a specific operation, with dedicated scenario classes and a robust support layer to minimize code duplication and simplify context management.

## Test Organization Structure

### Feature Files Organization
- Each `.feature` file groups scenarios related to a single operation
- Each scenario within a `.feature` file has its own unique encoding to make each step description unique, even when conceptually repeated across different scenarios
- This encoding approach allows gathering all steps of a scenario into a dedicated class

### Scenario Classes
Each scenario is implemented in its own dedicated class. This approach provides several key benefits:

1. **Simplified Context Management**: Scenario context becomes class attributes, eliminating the typical Cucumber problem known as **"Step Definition Sprawl"** or **"Scattered Step Definitions"**
2. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Each scenario class focuses solely on its specific test case
3. **Enhanced Maintainability**: Changes to a scenario only affect its dedicated class

### Code Reuse Strategy

To avoid code repetition that would naturally arise from having dedicated classes for each scenario, we implement a comprehensive support layer consisting of:

#### 1. DbFixtures Class
Generates all possible initial data configurations for test scenarios.

#### 2. Db Class
Provides database insertion and querying capabilities without requiring detailed SQL knowledge (acts as a GenericDao).

#### 3. Record Builder Classes
Generate records for database tables with default values using builder pattern:
- Format: `<table_name>RecordBuilder`
- Provide fluent API for creating test data

#### 4. DTO Builder Classes
Generate DTOs for various operations:
- Insert operations (`<service>Add`)
- Expected values for query services
- Services that return DTOs

## Syntax Conventions

### Builder Pattern Conventions

Our builders follow consistent naming conventions:

- **`with`** prefix: Adjusts an attribute
  ```java
  builder.withName("John").withAge(30)
  ```

- **`for`** prefix: Establishes a foreign key relationship
  ```java
  builder.forClient(clientId).forVehicle(vehicleId)
  ```

- **`build`** method: Generates the final object
  ```java
  Entity entity = builder.build()
  ```

### DbFixtures Naming Conventions

The `DbFixtures` class uses descriptive method names following this pattern:

#### Basic Patterns:
- **`a<Entity>`**: Returns a single record of type `<Entity>`
- **`some<Entity>`**: Returns a list of records of type `<Entity>`

#### Relationship Indicators:
- **`With`**: Indicates the record will be connected to others, forming a graph
- **`For`**: Indicates an ID must be provided to establish a foreign key
- **`Of`** (terminal): Indicates functional arguments must be provided
- **`And`**: Extends a "With" or "For" clause

#### Examples:

```java
// Single entities with relationships
aClientWithVehicleAndVehicleType()
aVehicleWithClientAndClientType()
```
*Note: Both examples generate the same object graph but return different root entities*

```java
// Multiple entities with relationships
somePayrollsWithContractsForProfessionalGroup(pgId)
```

```java
// Parameterized entity creation
aContractTypeOf(compensationDays)
```
*The "Of" terminal indicates parameters follow*
